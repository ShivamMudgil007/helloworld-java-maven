Doing 2nd commit for understanding.

It is the Integration between jenkins and github.

As, currently I am using a pubic repository, so, no credentials are required.
Only in the private repository, credentials are required.

Now, we are doing the testing of Poll SCM concept.
With this, jenkis will do the checkout from github automatically.
